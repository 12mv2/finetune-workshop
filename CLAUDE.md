# Claude Handoff Document - Halloween Hand Classification Workshop

## Project Overview
This is a 90-minute workshop teaching participants how to fine-tune YOLOv8 for binary image classification using RunPod GPUs. The workflow is: prepare data locally → train on RunPod → download model → run demo locally.

## Current Project State (Fully Tested & Working)

### What We Built
1. **Complete workshop materials** for fine-tuning YOLOv8 to detect hands (Halloween prop or real)
2. **Tested end-to-end** on September 1, 2025 with RunPod RTX A5000
3. **All scripts working** - dataset creation, training, live webcam demo
4. **Comprehensive documentation** including troubleshooting from real testing

### Key Technical Details
- **Model**: YOLOv8n-cls.pt (classification, not detection)
- **Classes**: `hand` and `not_hand` (binary classification)
- **Framework**: Ultralytics YOLOv8 with PyTorch
- **Cloud GPU**: RunPod with RTX A5000, PyTorch 2.4 + CUDA 12.4 template
- **Local inference**: Uses MPS on Apple Silicon Macs
- **Dataset format**: Folder-based (no annotations needed)

## Project Timeline

### Initial Development (September 1, 2025 - Earlier)
- **Time**: ~14:00-15:00 PST
- Created initial workshop materials
- Implemented dataset structure script
- Built live demo with MPS support
- Created documentation structure

### Major Updates (September 1, 2025 - Mid-session)
- **Time**: ~15:00-16:00 PST
- Switched from hand_prop to hand class naming
- Added freeze=10 parameter (later removed)
- Updated to SSH-first workflow
- Added tmux instructions

### Live Testing (September 1, 2025 - Later)
- **Time**: ~16:00-17:00 PST

#### Test Run Details
1. Created RunPod account and added SSH key
2. Deployed RTX A5000 pod with PyTorch 2.4 + CUDA 12.4
3. Connected via SSH: `ssh oyzsz5hz9pd68b-64410ff0@ssh.runpod.io`
4. Installed tmux (not pre-installed)
5. Created test dataset with 20 images
6. Uploaded via scp with port: `scp -r -P 40098 hand_cls root@213.192.2.74:/workspace/`
7. Trained model successfully (removed freeze=10 due to gradient error)
8. Downloaded model and ran webcam demo with MPS acceleration

### Key Learnings & Fixes

#### SSH & Connection
- SSH keys must be added to RunPod BEFORE creating pod
- First connection shows fingerprint warning - this is normal
- RunPod provides two SSH options - use the first, fallback to second with port

#### File Transfer
- rsync failed with "unexpected tag" error
- Solution: Use scp with port flag instead
- Must run from LOCAL terminal, not RunPod terminal

#### Training Issues
- `freeze=10` parameter caused "does not require grad" error
- Solution: Remove freeze parameter or use smaller batch size
- Default batch reduced from 32 to 16 for stability

#### Environment
- tmux not installed by default on RunPod
- Solution: `apt update && apt install -y tmux`
- Python environment uses /usr/local paths

## Important URLs & Resources
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/12mv2/finetune-workshop
- RunPod: https://runpod.io
- YOLOv8 docs: https://docs.ultralytics.com
- Model source: Hugging Face (auto-downloads)

## For Next Claude Session

### If continuing development:
1. Read this file first for context
2. Check `git status` for any uncommitted changes
3. The project is fully tested and working - be careful with changes
4. All major issues are documented in troubleshooting guides

### Common tasks you might be asked to do:
- Update for newer YOLOv8 versions
- Add support for multi-class classification
- Create slides for the workshop presentation
- Add more dataset examples
- Update for different cloud providers (Lambda Labs, etc.)

### Testing checklist:
- [ ] Local environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Dataset creation: `python3 create_dataset_structure.py`
- [ ] Model download: YOLOv8 auto-downloads from Hugging Face
- [ ] MPS detection: `torch.backends.mps.is_available()`
- [ ] Webcam access: `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`

## Critical Information

### What NOT to change without testing:
1. Don't add `freeze=10` back - it causes gradient errors
2. Don't change batch size above 16 for small datasets
3. Don't use rsync for uploads - scp is more reliable
4. Don't assume tmux is installed on RunPod

### Terminal Management
- **Local terminal**: For uploads, downloads, and local demo
- **RunPod terminal**: For training only
- Common mistake: Running upload commands on RunPod (won't work)

### Cost Management
- RTX A5000 costs ~$0.20-0.30/hour
- Training takes 5-10 minutes for real dataset
- **ALWAYS remind users to STOP their pod**

## Final Notes
This workshop has been successfully tested end-to-end. The materials are production-ready. Any changes should be tested with an actual RunPod instance before committing. The workflow is optimized for beginners and handles all common issues we encountered during testing.

## Video Capture Update (September 2, 2025)

### What We Added
1. **Video capture system** for quick dataset creation
   - `capture_dataset_videos.py` - Records 2x20 second videos with countdown
   - `extract_frames_to_dataset.py` - Extracts frames at 5 fps (100 per video)
   - `capture_and_prepare.py` - Combined workflow script

2. **Key Features**
   - 2-second preparation warning before recording
   - Visual countdown (3-2-1)
   - Automatic 80/20 train/val split
   - Creates perfectly balanced dataset (100 hand, 100 not_hand)

3. **Testing Results**
   - Dataset creation: 2 minutes (vs 30+ for manual photos)
   - Training time: <1 minute on RTX A5000
   - Model accuracy: 100% on validation set
   - Much more consistent than phone photos

### New Issues Discovered & Fixed

#### Python Environment Chaos
- User had multiple Python installations (pyenv 3.11.6, system 3.12.8)
- `pip install` went to different Python than `python3` command
- Solution: Use explicit paths like `/usr/local/bin/python3`

#### FFmpeg Package Confusion
- `pip install ffmpeg` installs wrong, outdated package
- Must use `pip install ffmpeg-python` for the correct wrapper
- Homebrew ffmpeg also needs to be in PATH

#### RunPod Training Setup
- `yolo` command not found - need to `pip install ultralytics` first
- Model saves to numbered directories (train3, not train)
- Training on 200 video-captured images takes <1 minute!

### Documentation Updates
- Added comprehensive troubleshooting to README
- Created `docs/video_capture_troubleshooting.md`
- Updated QUICK_REFERENCE.md with video capture option
- Emphasized video capture as primary method for workshops

### Why Video Capture is Better
1. **Speed**: 2 minutes vs 30+ minutes
2. **Consistency**: Same camera, lighting, angle
3. **Quality**: Better model performance (100% accuracy achieved)
4. **Simplicity**: No phone transfer, automatic organization
5. **Workshop-friendly**: Participants get results quickly

## Fast Upload Workflow Update (September 2, 2025 - Later)

### Problem Discovered
- User found model had false positives (95% confidence on body positions without hands)
- Uploading 400+ images for expanded dataset took too long (10-15 minutes)
- Solution: Upload videos instead of extracted frames

### Fast Video Upload Implementation
1. **Created new workflow** that uploads MP4s instead of JPEGs
   - `upload_videos.sh` - Interactive upload script (40MB in 1-2 min)
   - `runpod_extract_and_train.sh` - Extract frames on RunPod's fast infrastructure
   - `capture_videos_only.py` - Emphasizes fast workflow path
   - `docs/fast_workflow.md` - Complete documentation

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Upload time: 10-15 min → 1-2 min (5-10x faster)
   - Data size: 400MB → 40MB
   - Workflow time: 20 min → 10 min total

3. **Key Features**
   - Supports append mode for iterative improvements
   - Automatic frame extraction at 5 fps on RunPod
   - Progress indicators and time estimates
   - Fallback to scp if rsync unavailable

### Quick Cheat Sheet Added
Added complete workflow at top of README:
- Video capture → Upload → Train → Download → Demo
- All commands in copy-paste format
- Total time: ~10 minutes from start to webcam demo

### Why This Matters
1. **Workshop efficiency**: Participants see results faster
2. **Home internet friendly**: 40MB uploads work on any connection
3. **Iterative improvement**: Easy to add more data when model needs tuning
4. **Same quality**: Identical results, just faster pipeline

### Lessons Learned
- Compress early in pipeline when possible
- Leverage cloud compute for data processing
- Provide multiple paths based on user constraints
- Interactive scripts reduce user errors
