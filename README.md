# Quick Object Classification Workshop: Halloween Hand

This repository provides the materials for a 1.5â€‘hour workshop on fineâ€‘tuning **UltralyticsÂ YOLOv8** for image classification.  The goal is to train a binary classifier that detects whether a 3Dâ€‘printed Halloween hand is visible in an image and then build a fun live demo that reacts when the hand appears.

## âœ… Tested Workshop Flow

This workshop has been fully tested end-to-end. Here's what we'll do:

1. **Local Setup** (10 min)
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Create dataset structure: `python3 create_dataset_structure.py`
   - Add 50-100 images (or use test images for practice)

2. **RunPod GPU Setup** (15 min)
   - Add SSH key to RunPod settings
   - Create RTX A5000 pod with PyTorch 2.4 + CUDA 12.4
   - Connect via SSH (accept fingerprint prompt)
   - Install tmux: `apt update && apt install -y tmux`

3. **Upload & Train** (20 min)
   - Upload dataset: `scp -r -P [port] hand_cls root@[ip]:/workspace/`
   - Run training: `yolo classify train model=yolov8n-cls.pt data=/workspace/hand_cls epochs=15`
   - Training completes in ~5-10 minutes

4. **Download & Demo** (10 min)
   - Download model: `scp -P [port] root@[ip]:/workspace/runs/classify/train*/weights/best.pt ./`
   - Run demo: `python3 live_demo.py --weights best.pt`
   - Webcam opens with MPS acceleration on Mac

## Objectives

* **Fineâ€‘tune a pretrained model.**  We will start from the `yolov8nâ€‘cls.pt` weights (pretrained on ImageNet) and fineâ€‘tune only the classifier head to distinguish two classes: `hand` and `not_hand`.
* **Prepare a simple dataset.**  You will capture ~100 photos on your phone, organise them into a folder structure and split them into training/validation sets.  No bounding boxes or keypoints are neededâ€”class names are inferred from folder names.
* **Train and evaluate.**  We will train the classifier using a GPU pod on RunPod, monitor accuracy, and explore the outputs.
* **Live demo.**  Finally we will run a webcam loop locally on your Mac; when the `hand` class is detected, a spooky overlay or message appears on the frame.

## Getting Started

### Local Preparation (on your Mac)

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/halloween-hand-workshop.git
   cd halloween-hand-workshop
   ```

2. **Install dependencies locally** (for dataset prep and demo):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare your dataset** (see Dataset Preparation below)

### RunPod Training

1. **Create a RunPod GPU pod** using the PyTorch 2.4 + CUDA 12.4 template (see [RunPod Setup Guide](docs/runpod_setup.md))

2. **Connect via SSH** and start a tmux session:
   ```bash
   ssh root@[pod-host]
   tmux new -s train
   ```

3. **Transfer your dataset** from your local machine:
   ```bash
   # From your LOCAL terminal
   rsync -avh hand_cls/ root@[pod-host]:/workspace/hand_cls/
   ```

4. **Run training** - The pretrained `yolov8nâ€‘cls.pt` model will download automatically from Hugging Face:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace
   yolo classify train model=yolov8n-cls.pt data=/workspace/hand_cls epochs=15 imgsz=224 batch=32 device=0 freeze=10
   ```

## Dataset Preparation

Capture 50â€“100 images with your phone:

* **`hand`** â€” 25â€“50 photos of your 3Dâ€‘printed Halloween hand (or any hand) from different angles, distances and lighting conditions.
* **`not_hand`** â€” 25â€“50 photos of anything else (room backgrounds, household objects, your face, etc.).  These examples teach the model what *not* to classify as a hand.

Create the following folder structure relative to the repository root:

```
hand_cls/
  train/
    hand/
    not_hand/
  val/
    hand/
    not_hand/
```

Place ~80Â % of your images in `train` and ~20Â % in `val`.  The folder names are the class labelsâ€”there is no need for annotation files.

> **Tip:** If you donâ€™t have enough images, augment them by applying rotations, flips and colour jitter.  Data augmentation is built into YOLOv8â€™s classifier.

For more guidance on collecting and organising your photos, see **[`data_prep.md`](data_prep.md)**.

You can also use the provided script to create the folder structure:
```bash
python create_dataset_structure.py
```

## Training on RunPod

From the project root on your RunPod instance, run the following command.  Adjust `--epochs` to fit within your workshop time (10â€“15 epochs typically train in under 10Â minutes on a T4 GPU):

```bash
# Train a YOLOv8 classifier on your dataset.
yolo classify train \
  data=/workspace/hand_cls \
  model=yolov8n-cls.pt \
  epochs=15 \
  imgsz=224 \
  batch=32 \
  device=0 \
  freeze=10
```

During training youâ€™ll see logs showing training and validation accuracy.  YOLOv8 saves results in the `runs/classify/train` folder.  The **best weights** (based on validation accuracy) can be found at `runs/classify/train/weights/best.pt`.

To evaluate your model after training:

```bash
# Evaluate the trained classifier on the validation set
yolo classify val model=/workspace/runs/classify/train/weights/best.pt data=/workspace/hand_cls
```

## Live Demo

After training on RunPod, download your trained model to your local machine and run the demo.

### Download the Model from RunPod

From your local terminal:
```bash
# Download the trained model
scp root@[pod-host]:/workspace/runs/classify/train/weights/best.pt ./
```

### Run the Demo Locally

The demo script [`live_demo.py`](live_demo.py) runs on your local Mac using MPS acceleration.  It opens your webcam, feeds each frame to the trained model and overlays a spooky message when the `hand` class is detected:

```bash
python live_demo.py --weights best.pt --imgsz 224
```

The script will automatically detect and use Apple Silicon GPU (MPS) if available.  Press `q` to quit the demo.

## Known Issues & Solutions (From Testing)

### SSH & Connection
- **"authenticity can't be established"** â†’ Type `yes` (normal first-time connection)
- **tmux not found** â†’ Run `apt update && apt install -y tmux`
- **Wrong terminal confusion** â†’ Upload from LOCAL Mac, train on RunPod

### File Transfer
- **rsync fails** â†’ Use scp with port: `scp -r -P [port] hand_cls root@[ip]:/workspace/`
- **"subsystem request failed"** â†’ Use the direct IP connection (second SSH option)

### Training
- **"does not require grad" error** â†’ Remove `freeze=10` parameter or reduce batch size
- **CUDA out of memory** â†’ Use `batch=16` or `batch=8`

### General Tips
- Keep both terminals open (local + RunPod SSH)
- RunPod shows internal IP (172.x.x.x) - ignore it, use the SSH connection info
- Training on 20 test images takes seconds, real dataset (100+ images) takes 5-10 minutes
- **STOP YOUR POD** when done to avoid charges!
